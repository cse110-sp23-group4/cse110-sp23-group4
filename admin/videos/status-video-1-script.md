# Powell Rangers Status Video 1 Script

 ## Spec
 >Since you have just completed your first sprint and hopefully might have your first "walking skeleton" of an app and functional build pipeline it is time to show off our accomplishment.  To show off your hard work make a short 4 minute or less video (MP4 or Quicktime format) that presents the status of your software, the function of your pipeline and the health of your team.  You should also be transparent about any challenges you are facing which may have arising in your retrospective.  Finally conclude your video with a preview about what the next sprint will tackle and what stakeholders should look forward to after the next sprint.

 ## Overview of App
 The basis of our app is a spinoff of Tarot Cards. Users will be placed in the ambiance of an old fortune teller's shack in the middle of the forest. For functionality, users will be able to select a fortune from three categories: love, education, and life. From there, 6 cards will be displayed faced down and the user will get to choose. Each card will correspond to one of the following "fortune attitudes": Optimistic, Hopeful, Neutral, Pessimistic, Disastrous, and Wildcard. Upon submit, one of the fortune attitudes will be chosen. From there the fortune will be generated and displayed to the user.

 ## CRUD Aspect
 After receiving the fortune, users will have the option to either start the fortune telling process again, or save their fortune. Past fortunes can be accessed via our Fortune History page. This satifies the CRUD specification of our app.

 ## Current Status
 Curently, our app has the basic layouts of our wireframes and the ability to pick a card. You can also save your reading to Local Storage. Our designs for our overall theme, card design, and webpage styling are being finalized and implemented in the current sprint. Fortune responses have been drafted, but have not been fully implemented into the generation of the fortune.

 ## Team Pipeline
Currently the pipeline has a JS linter via JS Hint and an HTML/CSS validator. We have a workflow for JS Docs, however, it is not functioning as we had hoped. If the pull request passes all our code quality checks, then it deploys to GitHub Pages. We also have began implementing our Unit Test GitHub Action. It is still a work in progress.

 ## Team Health
 The health of our team is solid. Motivation remains strong while the team leads are cognizant of the stress of the final weeks of the quarter, ensuring that everyone has an appropriate level of work and being proactive to shift help to the right people if necessary.

 ## Challenges
 That being said, our team has faced some challenges. Communication amongst our members to ensure that the whole team is on the same page has been an issue we are working to resolve. Additionally, since we are full-time students, dedicating time to this project has been tough. We are working to address these issues by hosting more descriptive stand-up meetings and dividing tasks into smaller, more-manageable chunks.

 ## Future Plans
 The main thing that will be worked on in the last 2 weeks is the animations and polishing the overall look of our website. We want to make the "ceremony" aspect of fortune telling more dynamic, mystical, and eye-catching. This includes adding sliding card transitions, special webpage effects, and even basic animations to make it feel as if you are in the hut.
